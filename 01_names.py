## 1. Write a program that asks the user for their name, first and last name. Output a message that says "Welcome <Firstname>, <Lastname>!". Do not use modules/packages. (edited) 

firstname = input("What is your first name?")
lastname = input("What is your last name?")

print("Welcome " + firstname + ", " + lastname + "!" )
